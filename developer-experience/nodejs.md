Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. Users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks except when the I/O is performed using synchronous methods of Node.js standard library. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js.
